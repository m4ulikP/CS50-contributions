# CS50 Contributions

This repository contains my solutions and personal implementations of problem sets and projects from the CS50x course by Harvard University.

## 📘 Contents
- `credit.c` – Validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm.
- `plurality.c` – Simulates a plurality election voting system.
- `readability.c` – Calculates the U.S. grade level needed to understand a given text using the Coleman–Liau index.
- `scrabble.c` – Calculates scores for a two-player Scrabble-like game.
- `runoff.c` – Simulates a runoff election where voters rank candidates in order of preference.
- `substitution.c` – Implements a substitution cipher for encrypting text.
- `volume.c` – Modifies the volume of a `.wav` audio file by scaling samples.
- `mario.c` – Prints a "double pyramid" like the pyramids in Super Mario Bros.

## 🧠 About
These programs are written in C as part of the CS50x curriculum.  
Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, strings, algorithms, and file I/O.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Usage
Compile and run any program individually. Examples:

**Credit Card Validator**
```bash
make credit
./credit
