# CS50 Contributions

This repository contains my solutions and personal implementations of problem sets and projects from the CS50x course by Harvard University.

## 📘 Contents
- `credit.c` – Validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm.
- `plurality.c` – Simulates a plurality election voting system.
- *(add more as you progress!)*

These programs are written in C as part of the CS50x curriculum.  
Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, and algorithms.
